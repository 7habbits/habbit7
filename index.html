    <p class="headline">The Habit of Daily Self-Renewal</p>
    <div class="text1">
      <p>
        Sharpen the Saw means preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you
        have—you. It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the
        four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and
        spiritual.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you renew yourself in each of the four areas, you create growth and
        change in your life. Sharpen the Saw keeps you fresh so you can continue
        to practice the other six habits. You increase your capacity to produce
        and handle the challenges around you. Without this renewal, the body
        becomes weak, the mind mechanical, the emotions raw, the spirit
        insensitive, and the person selfish. Not a pretty picture, is it?
      </p>

      <p>
        You can pamper yourself mentally and spiritually. Or you can go through
        life oblivious to your well-being. You can experience vibrant energy. Or
        you can procrastinate and miss out on the benefits of good health and
        exercise. You can revitalize yourself and face a new day in peace and
        harmony. Or you can wake up in the morning full of apathy because your
        get-up-and-go has got-up-and-gone. Every day provides a new opportunity
        for renewal—a new opportunity to recharge yourself instead of hitting
        the wall. All it takes is the desire, knowledge, and skill.

        Living a life in balance means taking the necessary time to renew
        yourself. It’s all up to you. You can renew yourself through relaxation.
        Or you can totally burn yourself out by overdoing everything.
